      <p>
          Distributed or swarm robots are at the frontier of manufacturing, transportation, logistics, and exploration. Programming and managing such systems can be a laborious and error-prone. CyPhyHouse aims to provide application programming interfaces (APIs) and software (compilers, deployers, simulators, debuggers) for reducing above efforts by orders of magnitude. The aim is to enable large-scale experimental research needed for developing computing systems that support and rely on coordinated and controlled mobility, for example, in the study of mobility of WiFi access points, debuggers for mobile systems, and augmented-reality with real and virtual Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles, etc.
